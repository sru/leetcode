/**
 * # Problem
 *
 * You are given two __non-empty__ linked lists representing two non-negative
 * integers. The digits are stored in __reverse order__ and each of their nodes
 * contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 *
 * You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
 * number 0 itself.
 *
 * Definition for singly-linked list:
 *
 * ```
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode* next;
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * # Explanation
 *
 * Since the digits are stored in reverse order, we can go through each digits
 * and add them together, along with proper carry, to achieve addition on the
 * linked lists. The first loop goes through every digit pair on both `l1` and
 * `l2`. The second loop goes through every digits existing in one list but not
 * in the other. For such digits, we only care about digit places affected by
 * the carry; the rest remain as they are.
 *
 * ## Time Complexity
 *
 * Let `N` be the number of digits of the first integer and `M` the number of
 * digits of the second integer. The solution has time complexity of O(max(N,
 * M)).
 *
 * ## Memory Complexity
 *
 * There is no additional memory used that depends on input, so the solution has
 * constant memory complexity (O(1)).
