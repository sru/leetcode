/**
 * # Problem
 *
 * Given an array of integers, return __indices__ of the two numbers such that
 * they add up to a specific target.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have ___exactly___ one solution, and you
 * may not use the _same_ element twice.
 *
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 *
 * # Explanation
 *
 * This is a straightforward solution with nested loop. The outer loop finds the
 * first index and the inner loop finds the second index.
 *
 * ## Time Complexity
 *
 * Since there are `N choose 2`, `N * (N - 1) / 2`, such combinations of inputs,
 * the time complexity is O(N^2), where `N` is the number of elements.
 *
 * ## Memory Complexity
 *
 * There is no additional memory required besides the indices, so the memory
 * complexity is O(1).
